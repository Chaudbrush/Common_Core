### The School
42 School, also known as Ã‰cole 42, is an innovative coding institution founded by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel in 2013. It stands out with its tuition-free model and project-centered approach to teaching software engineering. Named after a reference in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," 42 School promotes peer-to-peer learning and independent study. The curriculum focuses on hands-on projects, utilizing gamification for skill enhancement through increasingly intricate coding challenges.

Notably, the admission process, known as the Piscine, assesses candidates' coding prowess. After the Piscine, the students admited go through the common core.

### Common Core
At 42 School, the Common Core is a set of programming projects and challenges that serve as a common starting point for all students. It ensures that everyone develops a baseline proficiency in coding and problem-solving skills before moving on to more specialized areas of study. The Common Core is designed to help students familiarize themselves with the school's unique project-based learning model and to create a level playing field for diverse learners.

Completing the Common Core demonstrates a student's ability to grasp fundamental coding concepts and effectively collaborate with peers, which are essential skills for success in 42 School's self-directed learning environment. After completing the Common Core, students have the freedom to explore more advanced projects and topics based on their interests and goals within the school's broader curriculum.
